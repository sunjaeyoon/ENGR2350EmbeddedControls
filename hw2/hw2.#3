/* The three errors that were in the code. The first was an incorrect syntax of printf which was spelled incorrectly,
the second was a missing closing bracket in the Summer function. 
The last was a missing semicolon in the code within the Spring function
*/

// This C code has three intentional syntax errors that must be corrected
//   before submitting this file for grading. Additionally, one error in 
//   the software logic exists, which should also be fixed.
//
// Forgetting to edit the personal information comments at the top will
//   result in losing some points.
//
// Your final code should be error and warning free. Deleting lines of 
//   code does not constitute a valid solution.
//
// NOTE: It is not necessary to run this code on the car, though you are 
// of course welcome to do so. If your submitted code does not compile,
// you will receive a grade of zero. To receive credit, your code must be
// free of both errors and warnings when it compiles.
